## Files

1. **snake_game.py**

   This file contains the implementation of the SnakeGameAI class, which manages the game state, user input, and the game loop.

2. **agent.py**

   The Agent class in this file represents the AI agent that plays the Snake Game. It uses a Q-learning approach to make decisions and improve its gameplay over time.

3. **model.py**

   Defines the neural network model used by the AI agent for Q-learning.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame torch numpy

## Training Process

The training script (agent.py) uses Q-learning to train the AI agent to play the Snake Game. It collects experiences during gameplay, stores them in memory, and updates the Q-values of the agent's actions to improve decision-making.

Run the training script:

  ``` bash
  python agent.py
```

This will initiate the training process for the AI agent.
